Week 5 Code Challenge
Problem: Lonely Integer
Description: Given an array of integers, where all elements but one occur twice, find the unique element.
Input: An array of integers a, Itâ€™s guaranteed that a has and odd number of elements and there's only one unique element
Output: An integer
Deadline: Monday, Dec. 11 EOD
Examples:
    A root node with no children: (00)
    A root node with two children: ((00)(00))
    An unbalanced tree with three consecutive left children: ((((00)0)0)0)
