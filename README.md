# Wizeline code challenge

## Week1

The solution is on the function **week1** in the **week1/solution.py** file.

Notes: The function expects the intervals input tuples to be `(minimum_value, maximum_value)`, so if the interval is set up as `(4, 3)` the solution will fail.

To run the tests execute from the project root directory:

```bash
python3 -m unittest tests/week1.py
```
